        <h2 class="heading">The Origin Of A Tank Main</h2>
        <p id =funParagraph>
            So you happen to have a tank, <s>and since your friend group doesn't,</s> you are forced to bring it out on every group expedition.<br>
            Congratulations! That means you're now a tank main. <b>Please do not resist.</b> Unless you're willing to delete that character, it's probably all you'll get to play for a very long time.<br>
            Lucky for you, I'm invested in your improvement! <s>If you do well enough, they'll stop making me tank everything!</s><br>
            So just follow my advice and you'll be fine! Probably.<br>
            I've listed out 5 pages of advice, ranging from the most important basics to some finer niche things that are very good to know, but won't be of much use until you've mastered the rest.
        </p>

            <a href="./DontDie.html" class="pageLink">Hold Aggro - Don't Die</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The very core of tanking is built around this concept:<br>
            Get enemy aggro, keep it, and don't die along the way.<br>
            This is done through taunting, blocking, healing, and managing your resources.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">
            <a href="./Build.html" class="pageLink">Build Set Up</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The right equipment can help you manage your resources better, or bring the utility you need to win the fight.<br>
            The general focus is on what kind of equipment you bring, what sets that equipment is made of, and the skills you put on your bars.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">
            <a href="./Utility.html" class="pageLink">Utility</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            If it's between staying alive and utility, you'd better choose staying alive.<br>
            However, if staying alive is a done deal, bringing utility can be the difference between your team staying alive, too.<br>
            Knowing what types of sets and skills will offer utility to your team can turn the tide!
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">
            <a href="./Buffing.html" class="pageLink">Buffing and Debuffing</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you've followed the guide this far, chances are you already apply a lot of buffs and debuffs. The main taunt you use applies major breach, for example.<br>
            Knowing what buffs and debuffs you've brought, what buffs and debuffs your teammates have brought, and how they will interact, is a very key point for endgame tanks.<br>
            Don't double dip, and make sure to bring the right buffs for your team!
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">
            <a href="./Positioning.html" class="pageLink">Positioning</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Your DPS friends have a lot of damage skills, but some of the most potent ones are Area of Effect Damage Over Time skills.<br>
            Knowing how to abuse the enemy AI to get them all to stand in one neat pile can greatly increase how much damage your teammates can do.<br>
            Sound simple? It's not. This is the pinnacle of good tanking.
