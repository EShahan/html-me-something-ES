            The right equipment can help you manage your resources better, or bring the utility you need to win the fight.<br>
            The general focus is on what kind of equipment you bring, what sets that equipment is made of, and the skills you put on your bars.

            Weapon Choice
        </h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>One Hand And Shield</li>
                <p>
                    This weapon gives you access to the cheapest taunt in the game (plus more perks in 'debuffing').<br>
                    Additionally it gives lots of passives for damage reduction and stamina sustain.
                </p>
                <li>Ice Staff</li>
                <p>
                    Access to one of the only two ranged taunts in the game, in addition to many utility options.<br>
                    It's passives are slightly less effective than a sword and board, but it's still defense oriented.
                </p>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading">
            Armor Choice
        </h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>5 Heavy, 1 Medium, 1 Light</li>
                <p>
                    Higher max resources thanks to the Undaunted Mettle passive.
                </p>
                <li>7 Heavy</li>
                <p>
                    Much higher defensive stats and passives, but less max resources (aside from HP), and slightly less utility.
                </p>
            </ul>

            Skill Set Up
        </h3>
        <p>
            There are six skills that are necessary in every tank loadout.<br>
            A cheap taunt, access to minor maim, a self heal based on your max HP, a stamina tool, an armor skill, a ranged taunt, and a survival ultimate.<br>
            Below are a few example loadouts for different classes.
