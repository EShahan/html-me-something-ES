    <h2>
        Build Set Up
    </h2>
    <p>
        The right equipment can help you manage your resources better, or bring the utility you need to win the fight.<br>
        The general focus is on what kind of equipment you bring, what sets that equipment is made of, and the skills you put on your bars.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Equipment
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Weapon Choice
    </h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>One Hand And Shield</li>
            <p>
                This weapon gives you access to the cheapest taunt in the game (plus more perks in 'debuffing').<br>
                Additionally it gives lots of passives for damage reduction and stamina sustain.
            </p>
            <li>Ice Staff</li>
            <p>
                Access to one of the only two ranged taunts in the game, in addition to many utility options.<br>
                It's passives are slightly less effective than a sword and board, but it's still defense oriented.
            </p>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Armor Choice
    </h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>5 Heavy, 1 Medium, 1 Light</li>
            <p>
                Higher max resources thanks to the Undaunted Mettle passive.
            </p>
            <li>7 Heavy</li>
            <p>
                Much higher defensive stats and passives, but less max resources (aside from HP), and slightly less utility.
            </p>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Skill Set Up
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are six skills that are necessary in every tank loadout.<br>
        A cheap taunt, access to minor maim, a self heal based on your max HP, a stamina tool, an armor skill, and a ranged taunt.<br>
        Below are a few example loadouts for different classes.
