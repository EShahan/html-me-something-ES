		</h2>
        <p>
            The very core of tanking is built around this concept:<br>
            Get enemy aggro, keep it, and don't die along the way.<br>
            This is done through taunting, blocking, healing, and managing your resources.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a href="./Build.html">Build Set Up</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The right equipment can help you manage your resources better, or bring the utility you need to win the fight.<br>
            The general focus is on what kind of equipment you bring, what sets that equipment is made of, and the skills you put on your bars.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a href="./Utility.html">Utility</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            If it's between staying alive and utility, you'd better choose staying alive.<br>
            However, if staying alive is a done deal, bringing utility can be the difference between your team staying alive, too.<br>
            Knowing what types of sets and skills will offer utility to your team can turn the tide!
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a href="./Buffing.html">Buffing and Debuffing</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you've followed the guide this far, chances are you already apply a lot of buffs and debuffs. The main taunt you use applies major breach, for example.<br>
            Knowing what buffs and debuffs you've brought, what buffs and debuffs your teammates have brought, and how they will interact, is a very key point for endgame tanks.

        </h2>
        <p>
            Your DPS friends have a lot of damage skills, but some of the most potent ones are Area of Effect Damage Over Time skills.<br>
            Knowing how to abuse the enemy AI to get them all to stand in one neat pile can greatly increase how much damage your teammates can do.<br>
