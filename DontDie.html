        <h2 class="heading">Hold Aggro - Don't Die</h2>
        <p>
            The very core of tanking is built around this concept:<br>
            Get enemy aggro, keep it, and don't die along the way.<br>
            This is done through taunting, blocking, healing, and managing your resources.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading">
            What is taunting?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Taunting is a skill that will make an enemy focus their attacks on you.<br>
            In this game, taunting is binary. If you've taunted the enemy, it will target you.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>
            What Skills Taunt?
        </h3 class="heading">
        <p>
            There are exactly three skills in this game that taunt.
            <ul>
                <img src="./Images/Pierce Armor.png" alt="Pierce Armor"><li>Puncture</li>
                <p>
                    This skill is available from the Sword and Shield skill line.<br>
                    It's short ranged, but is both cheap and strips armor. <b>Every Tank Should Use This.</b>
                </p>
                <img src="./Images/Inner Rage.png" alt="Inner Rage"><li>Inner Fire</li>
                <p>
                    This skill is available from the Undaunted skill line.<br>
                    This is a long range taunt. It's more expensive than puncture, but some fights will require you to have a long ranged taunt.
                </p>
                <img src="./Images/Frost Clench.png" alt="Frost Clench"><li>Destructive Clench</li>
                <p>
                    This skill is available from the Destruction Staff skill line, and must be morphed from Destructive Touch<br>
                    It's also a long ranged taunt, but is shorter than Inner Fire, more expensive, and requires you to use an ice staff for the skill to actually taunt.<br>
                    <b>The only upside over Inner Fire is that this skill applies Major Maim, which decreases the damage the enemy does by 10%</b>
                </p>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading">
            Stamina Management
        </h3>
        <p>
            Stamina regeneration is set to zero while blocking.<br>
            As a result, you'll need to limit how many stamina skills you use and know when to block to conserve it.<br>
            Skills, passives, and synergies which directly restore stamina are far more helpful as a result.

            Magicka Management
        </h3>
        <p>
            Don't overcast your healing!<br>
            Stack magicka regen enchants and use skills that restore magicka!
