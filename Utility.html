    <h1>Utility</h2>
    <p>
        If it's between staying alive and utility, you'd better choose staying alive.<br>
        However, if staying alive is a done deal, bringing utility can be the difference between your team staying alive, too.<br>
        Knowing what types of sets and skills will offer utility to your team can turn the tide!
    </p>
    <h2>Flex Spots</h2>
    <p>
        Utility sounds great and all, but where am I supposed to put these skills?<br>
        Flex Spots are just skills on your bar that aren't overly important.<br>
        When you realize you need or want a certain utility skill, these are the first skills you swap out.<br>
        Typically the first to go are any skills I didn't recommend in Build Set Up.
    </p>
    <h2>Positioning and Misc.</h2>
    <p>
        These would be your Chains, Stuns, Roots, Snares, Interrupts, Soft Aggro Tools, and Gap Closers.<br>
        Most dangerous enemies in trials are immune to these skills, so they're typically reserved for dungeons or specific trial fights.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Damage Mitigation</h2>
    <p>
        <b>"Hey, isn't this the healer's job?"</b><br>
        I mean, sure, if you wanna be anal about it. Realistically though, the healer is pretty busy. Doing what you can to help out goes far.<br>
        Now, you aren't a healer, so the skills you pick usually have to be %HP based synergies, minor lifesteal, or damage reduction.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Sustain
    </h2>
    <p>
        Any points a DPS puts into not running out of resources is points they don't put into damage.<br>
        Taking skills which offer synergies to restore resources, or that offer regen buffs, will free up room for your DPS to go full glass cannon.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Example Set Ups
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <ul>
        <p>
            Below are examples of how I'd arrange my flex spots in 3 different scenarios for a Dragonknight.
        </p>
        <li>vHoF Set Up</li>
        <image src="./Images/DK vHoF Set Up.png" alt="DK vHoF Set Up"></image>
        <li>vCR Set Up</li>
        <image src="./Images/DK vCR Set Up.png" alt="DK vCR Set Up"></image>
        <li>Dungeon Set Up</li>
        <image src="./Images/DK Dungeon Set Up.png" alt="DK Dungeon Set Up"></image>
        <p>
            In vHoF I realized I needed a purge, and couldn't chain,<br>
            In vCR I know I need lots of damage mitigation for the group,<br>
            And In Dungeons I know chains usually work, so I wanted to group quickly for my DPS.
        </p>
    </ul>
